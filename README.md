Kaaryasthan helps you to manage private projects.  You can add tasks & issues
(items) to your project.  An item has title, description, comments, creator,
assignees, and labels.  Project milestones can be created with due date and
items with the priority order.

This repository contains the source code of Kaaryasthan.  It has source code for
both user interface and server.  The user interface of Kaaryasthan is written in
[Angular], server in [Go], and [PostgreSQL] is used for the database.

> Kaaryasthan (‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥∞‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥∏‡µç‡¥•‡µª) is a [Malayalam] word with meaning "manager".

## Key Features

- All URLs requires authentication except login & registration.  (Note: This
  makes it unsuitable for open source projects with public issues.  Only private
  projects can be hosted using Kaaryasthan)

- Easy deployment.  Entire application including front-end is available as a
  single binary.  You also need to install PostgreSQL and NGINX unless you are
  using hosted PostgreSQL service.

## Development

You can clone [Kaaryasthan] repository inside `$GOPATH` using these commands
(Note: `$GOPATH` should be pointing to a single directory):

    mkdir -p $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/kaaryasthan
    cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/kaaryasthan
    git clone https://github.com/kaaryasthan/kaaryasthan.git

This project requires [Go] version 1.12 or above.  This project also requires
[Node] version 10.16 or above, preferably an LTS release.

Once Go and Node is installed, you can install these utilities:

- <https://github.com/pilu/fresh>
- <https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata>
- <https://github.com/elazarl/go-bindata-assetfs>
- <https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter>
- <https://cli.angular.io>

To install the above packages:

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kaaryasthan/kaaryasthan
    ./hack/install-deps.sh

Now you can run `make build` command.

    make build

Install [Docker] and [Docker Compose] and then run:

    docker-compose up -d

Migrate database schema by running:

    ./kaaryasthan -migrate

To run tests:

    make test

### Running development servers

To run the back-end development server (from the top-level directory):

    fresh

The back-end will listen on [8080] port.  Whenever there is a change in Go
source files, the server will be automatically restarted.

To run the front-end development server (from the `./web` directory):

    npm start

The web user interface will be available on [4200] port.  You can use Firefox or
Chrome to open it.  Any change in source files will refresh the user interface
automatically.  There is a webhook which does this magic.

Note: Frontend development is inactive now.  I am looking for contributors.  If
you are interested and know Angular and TypeScript, you are welcome to
contribute.

## FAQ

### Why this project?

I started this as a [pet project] for learning web application development
using Go & Angular.  In fact, I had started this [project in 2014] with
another name.

### Are you seeking external contributions?

Yes! You are welcome to contribute :-)

Please take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md] for more deatils.

### Why did you choose AGPLv3+ as the license?

I believe that's the best license for a web application.  From the
[GNU website]:

> The GNU Affero General Public License is a modified version of the
> ordinary GNU GPL version 3.  It has one added requirement: if you
> run a modified program on a server and let other users communicate
> with it there, your server must also allow them to download the
> source code corresponding to the modified version running there.

### Can I use Kaaryasthan to manage open source project tasks & issues?

I think that may not be possible.  Because all URLs will require
authentication except login & registration.  Since open source
projects requires public trackers, this won't be a desirable solution.
Kaaryasthan is designed exclusively for private projects.  And I am
not planning to change it. These are few reasons for not supporting
open source projects:

1. There are many good trackers available for open source projects.
2. Kaaryasthan is not exclusively designed for software projects.
3. Don't want to make the system complex to handle Slashdot effects.
4. No plan for search engine optimization (SEO for Google, Bing etc.).
5. Reduce the scope to keep the software as simple as possible.

The architecture doesn't support Kaaryasthan being used as a public
tracker. I explained this much in-order to not receive any feature
request for the same :-)
